# Learn LangChain from Scratch

## How to Install Packages

This tutorial uses `poetry` as the package manager. You need to install `poetry` first. Refer to [this guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for installation instructions.

After installing `poetry`, run the following command:

```
poetry install
```

An environment will be created inside the project directory. To activate the environment, run:

```
poetry shell
```

## How to Learn by Project

Each folder within the `/app` directory contains chapters for learning LangChain. You can run the Python scripts directly, or if it's a Jupyter notebook, you can learn within the notebook.
